			<summary><font color="blue"><u>ctf</u></font></summary>
      At the beginning i used nickname CokoL (~2009 year).
      <br>Every day 3-4 hours I played on ctf 16 players server
      <br>with same noobs like me (it was *gV*), in some day met
      <br>pro guy, I extremelly wanted to surpass him. Found
      <br>'aimbot by greentea' and start to play with it few weeks.
      <br>Accustomed to use triggered aimbot I successfully won
      <br>him on shotgun and hooks with aim :P. After some time
      <br>in 80% of times I got banned on servers. Decided to
      <br>learn how to play without aimbot, I changed my name to
      <br>ZoOoM and start play normally, that was not hard because
      <br>I already had experience from aimbot.  Met nice guys
      <br>from double clan (can't even remember name of leader),
      <br>they accepted me and taught everything on ctf1, ctf2,
      <br>ctf3 and ctf5. After some time double was closed, and
      <br>I found FeeL from <a target='_blank' class="block" href="http://dj-teeworlds.clan.su">Dj Team</a> clan. He introduced me to
      <br>dj_kemp, leader of Dj's, I started to play with them
      <br>(it was 2012 year). From that moment we participated in
      <br>quite a lot of trainings and fw's. Met a lot nice and
      <br>not so, guys: wHy (my skin creator) from Q Clan, Karatel
      <br>(always positive man), unNameD (smart and serious guy),
      <br>Louna (intelligent girl), all from ProteoS. Once time I
      <br>broke the keyboard, wasd doesn't response (arrows too
      <br>was broken) on hard fw (as i thought then) vs Doz' team.
      <br>I decided to play on num pad and we won that round 6:4
      <br>In summer 2012 we decided to create union of Dj and
      <br><a target='_blank' class="block" href="http://teecln.mirbb.net">ProteoS</a>, both clans had problem with activity and it was
      <br>the only way out to save us. Clan Oops! was born, after
      <br>a couple dozen of games, I leaved them because of issue
      <br>with some member. After some time clan Oops! was closed
      <br>due to inactivity. But I still meet players from ProteoS,
      <br>it's very nostalgic. In autumn 2012 I was accepted in
      <br><a target='_blank' class="block" href="http://eclipse-tw.clan.su/">[Eclipse]</a>, have met locr1d, a6ru, Karatel and wHy. The
      <br>level of play was significantly higher considering of
      <br>past clans haha, it was nice year with them, many fun,
      <br>fw's, rages, after i leaved [Eclipse] because I started
      <br>to dislike ctf gamemode, can't remember reason.

      At the end of 2012, I accidentally found zCatch gamemode.
      <br>It was old Teevision server with Arc, DR'9 and many small
      <br>clans. I started to love this gamemode because of speed
      <br>and the one chance to kill someone, played it everyday.
      <br>Almost every day I received warnings from other
      <br>players that I do too much spam haha^^'. In a couple of
      <br>months I got used to the game and clans have begun to
      <br>notice me. As I remember my first clan on zCatch was .eXe,
      <br>with suffix near of name. It was just a clan for fun and
      <br>after few weeks it was abandoned. As I liked some suffix
      <br>near of name i created .7z. After that time i had few clans
      <br>like Exp, Revolution, Mathematics and in the March of 2013
      <br>I was participated in first zCatch tournament by ONE clan.
      <br>As i remember match was started in 17-18:00, before that
      <br>I trained for 3 hours on the usual zCatch server.
      <br>The tournament ended after 3.5 hours, so we finished it
      <br>in ~21:30. I got second place, Jan from Arc' got first and
      <br>afri got third. As tournament on zCatch was a hype
      <br>I asked afri (leader of ONE and tournament organizer) to
      <br>organize second tournament, he said something like "okay
      <br>but not now, maybe in summer/autumn" after some time
      <br>I was invited in ONE and in Summer of 2013 was started
      <br>second tournament on zCatch. It was ended after 2.5 hours
      <br>by nameless tee (Yee) with camp tactic. I got second place,
      <br>Positiv third. After tournament I left ONE clan because afri
      <br>started to protect Yee that he is not camp on tournament.
      <br>In Autumn of 2013 played on Battle of Titans 1o1 tournament
      <br>between most skilled players on zCatch. Got 4-5 place, won
      <br>duel vs Lion, ic, didn't play normally on third round vs
      <br>Assa due of permanent micro lags. After that, there were
      <br>no significant events, I played on zCatch as usual, and I
      <br>still play (at the moment of 2018). In 2017 joined to RaD
      <br>and after few days left them because they wanted to more
      <br>strong players (for moving on gCTF arena I guess, and wanted
      <br>wins from members) and kicked MaraseaGirl without specific
      <br>reasons. Created with MaraseaGirl Seirei clan in Spring of
      <br>2017 without requirements and binding to gamemode.

      If be truly, in 2013 every guy on zCatch used gCTF gamemode
      <br>only for 1o1 duels to compare who better. In 2014 there
      <br>began to appear gCTF clans to fight 2o2, 3o3 etc.
      <br>Since I knew enough russian players from zCatch i decide to
      <br>create russian gCTF clan LastOne with Lowe, KiberKuK, chaos
      <br>and a few other players (don't remember). Began to teach
      <br>KiberKuK how to play better (was a bad teacher in the past).
      <br>Left LastOne because of KiberKuK that he uploaded screenshot
      <br>where he "won me ~10:3", it was his friend with my nickname,
      <br>commented this with "it was ez". In the spring of 2014 I was
      <br>invited to mew' by Cuube. Met Destin, CallMeGod, Js and much
      <br>other players. Left mew' (don't remember reason) and joined to
      <br>ObaY with Destin, Nexus, Black*Star and many other german
      <br>players. After few weeks joined again to mew'. Began to teach
      <br>second pupil 'Anki. Left mew' again and create YokU clan for
      <br>fun with my pupil. Quarreled with 'Anki and left him. Destin
      <br>invited me to GoT (Good old Times), there was Nexus, Genyar,
      <br>Cuube. Then GoT was renamed to Dominant!, more serious clan
      <br>for gCTF. After 4-5 months Cuube leave us and he invited me to
      <br>Sama, european vanilla clan (it was an attempt to return on
      <br>vanilla), after some time few players with me moved to AurOra
      <br>vanilla clan, then I came back to 'Mew again :'D (Spring of 2015).
      <br>In Summer of 2015 I talked with Cuube and we create WGH
      <br>(We Go Hard) gctf clan, it was the debut of Cuube, Js, shotm7
      <br>and me. Played much games, won vanilla fw's vs [EVIL] (6:5 and
      <br>6:3) etc. In 3 January of 2016 WGH clan played on first gCTF 2o2
      <br>tournament by kosmos. We participated with two teams from clan,
      <br>WGH #1 (Cuube, Blade), WGH #2 (Js, ZoOoM and shotm7). There
      <br>were 4 groups with 4 teams in each group. First match was vs
      <br>'Arc (Rilla and Vio), we won them with 10:7 and 9:7. After first
      <br>match WGH #1 had problem, Blade just went offline. We decided
      <br>with Cuube that I will play with Blade nickname, but I will also
      <br>play with WGH #2 team so that there is no suspicion. After few
      <br>minutes I played with Cuube vs HereForBeer (Pryde, Fun), and won
      <br>them  10:8. Then i switched to WGH #2 team and played with Js vs
      <br>hookz (Naruto, Awake (future Jax)), we won them 4:3 on ctf3.
      <br>After that we got the smallest group points and thought that
      <br>we were eliminated from the tournament, but after organizers
      <br>said that we have a chance and we went to best-of-three stage.
      <br>Then I switched again to WGH #1 and played with Cuube vs CMS
      <br>(Smash, CallMeGod), we won them 10:6 on ctf5, lose 4:8 on ctf4_old
      <br>and won 7:5 on ctf3. Lost in the next round vs Weed (Destin, Nexus)
      <br>5:8 on ctf4_old and 2:3 on ctf3. After I helped WGH #2 in choosing
      <br>map by winning Destin in 1o1 duel, and went to WGH #1. Next was
      <br>the match for third place, I played with Cuube (WGH #1) vs Rambo
      <br>(Imba, Razor) and won them 10:2 on ctf5 and 10:3 on ctf3.
      <br>When we finished match for 3rd place I found out that WGH #2
      <br>(Js, shotm7) lost 1:3 rounds vs Weed (Destin, Nexus). As clan,
      <br>we got the second and third place with 75 euros. What about me,
      <br>I left WGH due of problems with right hand, could not sleep few
      <br>nights, lost feeling of mouse on 1 month. Started a bit recover
      <br>my skill on zCatch, played much easy games with new pupil
      <br>Karti in Love. Then came back to WGH as inactive player. Played
      <br>a bit fw's for clan statistic wins: 79, loses: 25, win rate: 76%.
      <br>In the March of 2016 I left WGH and in the Summer I was invited by
      <br>Destin to Legends, with Nexus, Cuube, Genyar, CallMeGod. Clan got
      <br>bad reputation due of Destin, Nexus and Genyar behavior and in
      <br>Autumn of 2016 I left them. After week I tried to join in kosmos
      <br>clan but due of words anonymous guy about kosmos, and behavior of
      <br>x0sef I decide to cancel my application. I had restored old LastOne
      <br>with Skyrx (KiberKuK), Nerox and Naruto. After 12 fw's with with my
      <br>participation (still had problem with hand), Skyrx and Nerox accused
      <br>me that I don't play so often and do nothing for the clan statistics.
      <br>Due of this reason I left them in December and create Seirei clan
      <br>without requirements in skill, when u play gamemode which you want,
      <br>when and how much u want. In February 2017 I participated on second
      <br>gCTF 2o2 tournament by kosmos with Js as Fairy Tail team and got
      <br>fourth place and prize 40 dollars. After tournament i stopped play
      <br>gCTF seriously due of games became monotonous, without some fire
      <br>in moves from enemy, it was a camp game on mid and escaping from
      <br>enemy when he find you. In Autumn of 2017 tried to back on serious
      <br>gCTF by joining to Aura, Js's clan but to no avail.
